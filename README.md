# Customer Loan Eligibility Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying potential customers for loan services within the banking industry. Using customer data, I applied SQL and Excel to detect patterns and profiles that indicate a customer's potential eligibility for a loan. This project showcases my data analysis skills and my understanding of banking operations, particularly in loan assessment and customer segmentation.

## Objective
The goal of the project is to use customer information to detect high-potential customers who could be offered loans. By analyzing customer demographics, transaction history, and other relevant data, I aimed to build a data-driven approach to assist in customer targeting for loan offers.

## Tools Used
SQL: For extracting, filtering, and analyzing customer data from the database.
Excel: For visualizing the results.

## Key Features of the Project
Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers based on relevant attributes such as income, credit score, and transaction history to identify high-potential loan customers.

Data Querying using SQL: Wrote SQL queries to filter and retrieve relevant customer data for analysis.

Analysis and Insights: Analyzed the data to detect patterns and trends that help in predicting customer eligibility for loans.

Visualization: Used Excel to create graphs, pivot tables, and charts for clear representation of insights.

## Data Analysis Steps
Understanding Customer Profiles: The analysis begins by creating profiles of customers with high potential to use credit services. This includes:
- Customers with high or low income.
- Customers with a strong correlation between income and geographic location.
- Examining trends by age groups and regions.

Segmentation by Geography and Income:
- Customers in Africa, Asia, and Australia tend to have lower incomes, while those in Europe and North America have higher incomes.
- Income variations are also visible across regions, which highlights potential markets for loan offerings.

Monthly Income and Spending Behavior:
- The analysis includes grouping customers based on their monthly income and comparing spending habits to identify regions where loan products may be more suitable.
- Customers in Australia had the highest average income, while those in Africa exhibited lower spending, indicating differing credit needs across regions.

Family and Age Factors:
- Families and individuals with high-income levels in specific age ranges are assessed, such as customers in the 40â€“50 age group who are most likely to be potential loan recipients.
- Family size also plays a role in the loan eligibility analysis, as larger families may have different financial needs.

Customer Insights and Findings:
- The final analysis shows that customers in specific regions (e.g., Europe) with a high monthly income are more likely to be good candidates for loan products.
- Younger customers (ages 30-40) in Africa, Australia, and Asia, particularly those with families, are identified as another potential target group.

## Findings


## Skills Demonstrated
SQL querying to retrieve and analyze customer data. 

Excel techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization: Pivot Charts, Slicers,...

Customer profiling based on attributes related to loan eligibility.

Data-driven decision-making to support targeted marketing efforts.

## Potential Enhancements
Expand the project to include predictive modeling techniques for loan eligibility using Python or other data analysis tools.

Implement additional data sources to enrich customer profiles (e.g., spending behavior, loan repayment history).

Automate the analysis process using a dashboard tool like Power BI or Tableau.
